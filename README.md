## Human vs Mountains – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on the relationship between humans and mountains — including climbing attempts, risk factors, success rates, and variables influencing expedition outcomes.


## The main goals of this analysis are to:
- explore relationships between key variables
- identify factors influencing success or failure
- visualize important trends in the dataset
- draw meaningful conclusions based on statistical exploration

## The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Data visualization (trends, distributions, relationships)
- Interpretation of results

## The project was developed using:
- R
- R Markdown
- Pandoc (HTML export)
- Data analysis and visualization libraries (ggplot2, mice, scales)
